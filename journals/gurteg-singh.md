# Individual Journal - Gurteg Singh 

## Journal Entry 1 (Week 1: 11/08 - 11/15)
  -My group and I met together to discuss what we wanted to do for this project and what type of company we wanted to mock or create. We also talked about how we wanted to set up the implementation and architecture and decided to split the work as evenly as we could. I decided to research how to encorporate mysql db into our app and using spring security for login and registration. 
  
  ### Challenges
   - There were no challenges this week, as we mostly just met to get an idea of what to do for our project.
   
## Journal Entry 2 (Week 2: 11/15 - 11/22)
  -The team decided to meet again and share our progress on researching ways to implement the various functions. We decided it was time to start implementing and distributed work to those who felt most comfortable with a topic. I decided to go ahead and try to implement a working user registation and login page and have the data stored in a local mysql container. 
  
  ### Challenges
    -Again, since this was just another meeting, there were no challenges besides trying to find a meeting time that worked for everyone due to the upcoming thanksgiving holiday.
