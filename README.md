## Project Description

Team Gumball created a Candy Shop where customers can login/sign up and select candy from our shop, add it to cart, cheackout and make payments. For more details about the backend, look at our diagrams.

Four seniors got together to build this candy shop from ground up. We put in our blood, sweat and tears to make this dream of ours a reality. Please support our small business! Hope you enjoy!

## Setup for our Candy Shop Application

### Docker

Start up Docker Desktop and have the MySql container running.

```bash
docker run -d --name mysql -td -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=welcome mysql:8.0
```

### MySQL

On terminal, run the following commands.

- The mysql username = admin
- the password = welcome
- the database = cmpe172
- the table = users

```bash
$ docker exec -it mysql bash
```

```bash
/# mysql --password
Enter password:
```

```bash
create database cmpe172;
```

```bash
USE cmpe172;
```

```bash
create user 'admin'@'%' identified by 'welcome';
```

```bash
grant all on cmpe172.* to 'admin'@'%';
```

```bash
select * from users;
```

For our admin login to the candy shop, we need to insert an ADMIN_ROLE into the mySQL Database. To do this run the following command in the mysql shell.

```bash
INSERT INTO users(id, email, firstname, lastname, password, roles, username) VALUES(1, 'admin@email.com','admin','admin','admin','ROLE_ADMIN','admin');
```

### MongoDB

To access the Mongo Database, download MongoDB Compass.

To get started with MongoDB, run the following commands on your terminal.

```bash
sudo pip3 install mysql-connector
```

```bash
sudo pip3 install mysql-connector-python
```

```bash
sudo pip3 install pymongo
```

- Front Office Portal
  - User can register for an account.
  - User can login/sign out of their account.
  - User can navigate/browse through our candy shop products.
  - User can process their desired order.
  - User can pay for their order.
- Back Office Portal
  - Admin role exists for employees ONLY.
  - Admins can manually create/add a customer into the database.
  - Admins can manually delete a single customer or delete all customers from the database.
- Integration with CyberSource Payments
  - Customer can add items to their cart, checkout and finalize their purchase/payment.

### Software Stack and Tools

- Used Spring Framework(Spring MVC, Spring JP, etc.) for the whole project.
- The front office portal utalizes front end technologies like HTML and CSS.
- The development tools that were used were:
  - all the builds were done with Gradle 5.6
  - the version of Java should be JDK 11
- The database and middleware requirements used were mySQL DataBase 8.0 and RabbitMQ.
- Credit card payments were done with integrating through CyberSouce Payment Gateway.

### Extra Credit

- We explored other GCP features and services like Cloud SQL
- We explored using MongoDB in our project.
